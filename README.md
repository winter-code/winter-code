### Hi there 👋

I like to code, read, paint and click. For me, accomplishments == learning one new thing daily. 

- 🔭 I'm a cloud engineer at Google, have an experience of working at a start-up, love vscode and going out. I'm hardly ever able to go out though. I also work with the GCP monitoring APIs team.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Django and indoor plants. 
Please ask me how you'd approach a problem, because I love discussing probable solutions at length. I drift a lot while talking but I can organise things very well on paper. 👩🏼‍💻
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love sleeping but can stay up for two days straight. 😴 I lovvve gardening! 🌱
